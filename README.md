## About The Project

Welcome to my React assignment with Google authentication and API integration!

This application was built using React and Firebase for Google authentication. The application pulls data from the DataUSA API, specifically the population statistics of different nations.

To run the application locally, first clone the repository from GitHub. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command in the terminal: npm start

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. You can then view the application and its functionality.

The deployed version of the application can be found at the following link: https://listed-assignment-12018667.netlify.app/

The application allows users to sign in using their Google account and view the population statistics of different nations. Users can also search for a specific nation and view its population statistics.

The application is deployed using Netlify, a cloud computing platform that allows for easy deployment and hosting of web applications.

Thank you for checking out my assignment!

## Built With

React, Chartjs library, API, Netlify

## Getting Started

### Installation

Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Roadmap
